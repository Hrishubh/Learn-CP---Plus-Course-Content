## Stack: Classical Problems (MUST WATCH VIDEO)

#### <ins>Converting an infix expression in the form of postfix/prefix expression</ins>
#### <ins>Creating Postfix using Infix:</ins>

#### <ins>Example:</ins><br>
5 + 10 * 15 + 8 - 9 / 3 [Prefix]<br>
5 + (10 15 * ) + 8 - (9 3 / )<br>
(5 10 15 * + ) + 8 - (9 3 / )<br>
(5 10 15 * + 8 + ) - (9 3 / )<br>
5 10 15 * + 8 + 9 3 / - [Postfix]<br><br>
<i><ins><b>Note:</b></ins> Postfix equation is also called <ins>Polish Equation.</ins> <br> 
<ins><b>Note:</b></ins> Number of operators (+ - * /) is 1 less then number of operants.<br>
<ins><b>Note:</b></ins> Prefix expressions are also there but are generally not used as it is almost identical to postfix and postfix is more user friendly. <br>
<ins><b>Note:</b></ins> Number of elements in the stack at any point is equal to the number of operants minus the number of operators.</i> <br><br>

<ins>Calculation of Postfix Equation:<br> https://github.com/Hrishubh/plus-course-content/blob/main/Basic_Data_Structures/L7/evaluate_post.cpp <br>or <br>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-set-4-evaluation-postfix-expression/ </ins> <br><br>

#### <ins>Stock span question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-stock-span-problem/ - Specially study the previous greater value type (and similar next greater, prev smaller and next smaller)<br></ins>
<br>

#### <ins>Largest rectangle which can be formed in a Histograph (using prev and next smaller for each index)</ins>
