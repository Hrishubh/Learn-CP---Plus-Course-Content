## Queue and Deque: Classical Problems
#### <ins> Given an array of integers and a number K. Find and print the max of each subarray of size K seperated by spaces.</ins>
#### Solution: https://github.com/Hrishubh/plus-course-content/blob/main/Basic_Data_Structures/L9/max_in_k_sliding_window.cpp - This solution also includes fxn with which we can solve this problem using a map!
#### <ins>Given N people, M pairs of friends are given. A person comes to a party only if at least K of his friends are coming, find out the maximum number of people who can come to the party for the given values of N,M,K:-</ins>
#### Solution: https://github.com/Hrishubh/plus-course-content/blob/main/Basic_Data_Structures/L9/party_with_min_k_friends.cpp - This the implementation of this solution using Queue

### <b>Note: Space Complexity is never greater then Time Complexity</b> as we will take time to at least declare variables which use the space, so that will at that time, before any processing make space complexity and time complexity equal.
