# Mixed Problems in Stack, Queue and Deque
### <ins>Question: Given 2 arrays X(sorted) and P(unsorted). Find the pair of distinct integers i and i such that abs(x[i]-x[j]) + p[i] + p[j] is maximum under the following conditions:</ins>
<pre>   1) No Condition</pre>
<pre>   1) If x[j]-x[i] <= K </pre>
<pre>   1) If 0<=x[i]<=360 and **x[j] - x[i]** is min(x[j] - x[i], 360-(x[j] - x[i]) )</pre>
